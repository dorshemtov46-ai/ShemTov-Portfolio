## Overview
**Warriors Merge** is a fast-paced bag-management game built around strategic inventory decisions and **base-vs-base auto battles**.  
It was created as a **Voodoo rapid prototype**, where the goal was to ship a solid V1 quickly and validate performance via KPIs.

## My Role
I worked as **Game Designer + Project Manager**, owning the V1 from **ideation → shipped App Store build**.

**What I owned:**
- Core mechanics and game loop (bag decisions → combat outcomes → progression)
- **Level design** (content planning, pacing, difficulty curve)
- **Balancing** (economy, upgrades, enemy tuning, progression speed)
- Feature scoping for a V1 (meta + content that supports KPI goals)
- Day-to-day planning and delivery with the team

## Team
Developed by a **team of 4**:
- **Me:** Game Designer + Project Manager  
- **Lead Art**
- **Tech Artist**
- **Developer**

## Production Context
This was made in a **fast Voodoo production cycle** (around one month) where we aimed to deliver:
- ~20 levels worth of playable content (V1 scale)
- A single meaningful meta feature
- A balanced experience that can be measured against KPI targets

## Results (KPI Focused)
This prototype achieved:
- **D1 retention:** ~40%
- **D7 retention:** ~11%
