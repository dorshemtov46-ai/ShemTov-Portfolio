Iris A third-person platformer with an emphasis on puzzle solving and adventure-driven exploration.

## My Role
My first big project as a student. I was in charge of the game design , level design of the game. Including puzzles , level layout and player abilities.
* Researched level design for the project learning from top 3D adventure platformers
* Using iterative design by getting feedback and improving puzzles.
